# HOPtimist

## Project Overview
*** 
[Hoptimist](https://hoptimist-app.herokuapp.com/) is a functional clone of the Untappd app, with some changes to the sites general css and feel. This full stack project was created to help improve my skills with React / Redux as well as solidify my utilization of a sequelize / express backend. 

### MVP Features and Completed Stretch Goals
* Account Creation / Login / Logout / Guest-Login
* CRUD Beer Functionality
* Review Beers
* Review Feed
* User Profile
* Search

### Home Page and Navbar

While on the home page, you can clearly see the banner for the application, as well as the 10 most recently added beers. The navbar has links for user auth and creation as well as a search bar so that a user can easily find the beer that they are trying to review or inspect. Also on the navbar, there is a clickable logo that will alway redirect the user to the home page from anywhere in the site. A logged in user has a button on the navbar that will redirect them to their own personal user page.
